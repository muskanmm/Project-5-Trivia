# Project 5 - Trivia

Submitted by: Muskan Mankikar

Trivia is an app that allows users to select the parameters of their trivia round and then answer some questions that are rendered based on their inputs. Their score is calculated after submission. 

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] App launches to an Options screen where user can modify the types of questions presented when the game starts. Users should be able to choose:
  - [x] Number of questions
  - [x] Category of questions
  - [x] Difficulty of questions
  - [x] Type of questions (Multiple Choice or True False)
- [x] User can tap a button to start trivia game, this presents questions and answers in a List or Card view.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
